> **TL;DR:** I'm Jon and I have been a developer/architect/leader in tech for about 20 years, and I've decided to break out from my corporate chains and start building my own open source project. I want to document what I do along the way and also start documenting my designs, architecture, and crazy AI experiments.  Hope you come along for the ride!
