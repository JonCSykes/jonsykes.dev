        Builder and founder, and an engineering leader by trade. I spend a lot
        of time designing systems, shipping software, and figuring out which
        “best practices” actually hold up in the real world.

        This blog is where I write the posts I wish existed. Practical deep
        dives on AI, architecture, and modern engineering. I share what is
        working, what is not, and why. Usually with examples, decision rules,
        and lessons learned the hard way. No hype. Just honest notes from my
        experiences.
